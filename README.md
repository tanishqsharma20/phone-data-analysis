# phone-data-analysis
this is a excel project for the analysis of mobile phone
A small data-analysis project focused on mobile phone data. The repository holds raw and cleaned datasets and an Excel presentation documenting findings and visuals.
Repository contents

raw_data/ — original/unprocessed data files (source data to be cleaned and analyzed).
cleaned_data — processed datasets ready for analysis.
README.md — basic project README.
phone-data-analysis/excel file/phone data presentation.xlsx — Excel workbook containing charts, tables, and a presentation of the analysis.
Typical workflow

Ingest data from raw_data/.
Clean and transform into cleaned_data (remove duplicates, normalize formats, handle missing values).
Exploratory data analysis (summary statistics, distributions, correlations).
Create visualizations (price vs. specs, brand market share, trends over time).
Summarize insights and produce the phone data presentation.xlsx (slides/charts/tables).
Possible analyses and outputs

Descriptive stats: average price, median battery/camera specs, top brands.
Market-share and trend charts: units sold by brand, price segments.
Feature relationships: price vs. RAM, battery life vs. price, correlation heatmaps.
Recommendations: product positioning, target segments, pricing strategy.
Suggestions to improve the project

Add a clear README.md with project goals, data sources, and run instructions.
Include analysis code (Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts) in a notebooks/ or src/ folder to reproduce figures from the Excel file.
Add a requirements.txt or environment.yml describing dependencies.
Document data schema and cleaning steps in cleaned_data so others can reproduce the pipeline.
If you want, I can expand the README.md with a full project description and usage instructions or create a starter Jupyter notebook to reproduce the Excel analysis.
